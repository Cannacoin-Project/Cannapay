TODO:
-Implement bitcore libs, explorer and BIP32 implementation for key creation/storage.
- Investigate Meteor.js for it's reactivity, tight mongo integration and for mobile support via Cordova/Phonegap.
- Investigate Mylar frame work (using meteor) for full server side encryption of data (keys etc.)
- Finish API code for open sourcing (potentially start new process/repo for API)
- Move common functions like isLoggedIn, isApiKeyValid along with any speakeasy configuration into seperate module/package. Dont repeat yourself stupid... KISS
- Use new modern npm pacakges for bittrex and other exchanges.  KISS, at the time of making cannapay none were available but now more updated libs exist so lets use those
